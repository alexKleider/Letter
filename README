    Attempt to use sqlite3 to maintain a data base supporting
    letter writing utilities.  
    It's a scaled down version of what I developed under
    Club/Utilities (which used csv) to send out mailings.

Currently (as of Sun 15 Dec 2024 02:28:15 PM PST) not working!
A "Data" directory is excluded from the repository but can be
restored by decrypting and extracting the "tar.gz.gpg" file.
